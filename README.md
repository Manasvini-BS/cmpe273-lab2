# cmpe273-lab2

This is the submission folder for Lab #2.
I have downloaded httprouter folder from github and kept it in the same directory where my .go file is running. 
so I have changed import path for the httprouter to relative path of the folder.
To successfully execute the go file , we have to keep httprouter folder inside same folder where .go file is kept.
server is running at port 8080 localhost
